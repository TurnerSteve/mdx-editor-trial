# LIN File Format for Bridge Games

The LIN file format is another widely used format in the bridge community. It is mainly used for recording and exchanging bridge hands, auctions, and results in a compact, machine-readable way. LIN files are particularly popular in tools like Bridge Base Online (BBO).

---

## General Structure

LIN files are text-based and consist of key-value pairs separated by vertical bars (`|`). Each pair starts with a key (a single letter or a short abbreviation), followed by its value. Multiple key-value pairs are concatenated into a single line.

### Example:
```
vg|Generated by TurnerSteve|st||md|1SAKQJH543DAKJC543 KQJ.KQJ.QJ.QJ||sv|o|rh||ah|Board 1|mb|1C|mb|Pass|mb|1H|mb|Pass|mb|1NT|mb|Pass|mb|3NT|mb|Pass|mb|Pass|mb|Pass|pn|North;South;East;West|pg||pc|2D|pc|3H|pc|5S|pc|6C|
```

## Key Sections of LIN Files

### **1. Metadata**
- **`vg`**: Indicates the generator of the LIN file. Example: `vg|Generated by TurnerSteve|`
- **`st`**: Status or additional context (optional).
- **`ah`**: Annotation for the board.

### **2. Board Setup**
- **`md`**: Specifies the deal. The format is `md|<dealer><card distribution>|`, where:
  - `<dealer>`: Dealer's direction (`1` for North, `2` for East, etc.).
  - `<card distribution>`: 
    - Cards for each player are separated by "," 
    - Each suit starts with S,H,D or C. even if its an empty suit.
    - There will ideally be 4 sets of 13 cards, so 52 unique cards but thats not a (file) error. 
    - Partial and/or illegal deals (duplicate cards) are quite OK.
    - Cards seem to be in order but maybe that is not obligatory.  
    - Seeems there is a  'pipe' to start and finish the deal sequence.
    - Example: `md|1SAJ54H54DAKJC5432,1SAJ54H54DAKJC5432,1SAJ54H54DAKJC54321,SAJ54H54DAKJC5432|`
- **`pn`**: Player names in the order: North, South, East, West. Example: `pn|North;South;East;West|`
- **`sv`**: Vulnerability. Options are:
  - `o`: None
  - `b`: Both / All
  - `n`: North-South
  - `e`: East-West

### **3. Auction**
- **`mb`**: A bid in the auction. Example: `mb|1C|` represents a 1 Club opening bid.
- **`rh`**: Reserved for the auction header.
- **`pg`**: Indicates the end of the auction or a placeholder.

### **4. Play**
- **`pc`**: Played card. Example: `pc|2D|` indicates the 2 of Diamonds was played.

### **5. Results**
- **`mc`**: Contract result, including declarer and tricks taken. Example: `mc|3NW|` indicates 3 tricks made by North-West.
- **`mn`**: Match number (optional).

## Comments and Annotations

- LIN files can include comments using the `ah` key for annotations or descriptions.
- Example: `ah|Board 1|` provides a simple title or description for the board.

---

## Compact Representation

LIN files are highly compact, with the absence of line breaks for most data. This makes them efficient for transmission but harder for humans to read compared to other formats like PBN.

---

## Encoding and Compatibility

- LIN files are plain text and should use UTF-8 encoding.
- They are primarily intended for use with BBO and other compatible tools.

## Example LIN File

```

## Comparison with PBN

| Feature               | LIN Format       | PBN Format       |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Encoding              | Compact          | Readable         |
| Popularity            | BBO Tools        | Bridge Software  |
| Annotation Support    | Limited          | Extensive        |
| Human Readability     | Medium           | High             |

Both formats are widely accepted and serve complementary purposes depending on the use case.
