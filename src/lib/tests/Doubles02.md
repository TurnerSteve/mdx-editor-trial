\emdash  Doubles
\par by Marc Smith
\par 
\par Last month, we began by deciding that Modern Bidding Theory proposes overcalling on many hands that in times gone past would have begun with a double. In fact, what you are really doing on these hands is switching the order of your bids.
 This month we look at how you can use a second-round double to give your side more options...

\par 
\par RHO opens One Diamond. In days of old, most players would have doubled, intending to bid their hearts on the next round...

\par 
\par RHO\tab You\tab LHO\tab Pard
\par 1dx\tab Dble\tab Pass\tab 1sx
\par Pass\tab 2hx\tab ...
\par 
\par Now ask yourself how you would bid the following hand after RHO opens One Diamond...
\par 
\par sx\tab 8
\par hx\tab AKJ763
\par dx\tab K74
\par cx\tab AJ6
\par 
\par Would you not choose one of the sequence
s above to describe this hand? If you wish, make the second hand even stronger, although not good enough to double and then jump to Three Hearts. As you can see, there is a world of difference between these two hand types, and thus adopting the same aucti
on on each is unlikely to result in your partner making the right decision on a regular basis. Indeed, the opponents might life more difficult for you too...

\par }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 If the enemy's bidding forces you to show your heart suit for the first time at the 3-level, you would surely be much more comfortable holding the second hand.
\par 
\par In each of the auctions so far, you have taken two bids to describe your hand. First you have let partner know that you have a decent hand and then, at your second turn, you told him that you had hearts. Modern Theory suggests that it is 
more efficient to switch the order in which you provide partner with the same information. Consider how much easier many of these auctions
 become when you start by telling partner that you have hearts. You can always show your extra values at your second turn....

\par 
\par This time LHO passes. If you had started with a double, you would have to decide whether to raise partner's spades (risking a 4-3 fit) or to introduce your hearts.  Having already shown your hearts, it is now 
clear to raise spades. Partner has already suggested that he is not overly keen on hearts, and he will only rarely have a 4-card spade suit.
\par 
\par However, it is when the opponents bid again that the more descriptive start is of most benefit.

\par }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 
\par Now you have an easy double. This shows a better than minimum overcall and at least tolerance for the two unbid suits (or a }{\i\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 very }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 good hand). Even if LHO 
had raise to Three, or even Four, Diamonds, you should be happy to double. Of course, one of the chief benefits of this auction over the one shown earlier is that your partner can elect to defend a doubled contract. 
Obviously, that is not an option when you double first and then bid your suit.
\par 
\par Many doubles that would once have been considered as being strictly for penalties are now widely accepted to be for takeout. This is particularly true of any low-level double when your side has not yet agreed a suit. 
Double is now commonly utilised to say, "I have some values, but no obvious forward-going move."

\par 
\par What would a double mean? Is it a penalty double of clubs? What does it say about your relative major-suit lengths? The answer is that it shows everything and nothing. It simply says, "I have a hand on 
which I do not want to pass, but I do not have anything clear to say." Perhaps your hand is something like:
\par 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 sx\tab K3
\par hx\tab AQ874
\par dx\tab 974
\par cx\tab AJ9
\par }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 
\par Your hearts are not good enough to repeat. You would rather not support spades on just a doubleton. You cannot bid no-trumps with three low diamonds. You are not strong enough to force to game. Double has the benefit of flexibility \emdash 
 it keeps all options open, including that of defending Two Clubs Doubled.}{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 
\par }{\fs24\lang2057\cgrid0 
\par You do not have to overcall on the first round either. How would you play double in the following auction?

\par 1sx\tab Pass\tab 1NT\tab Pass
\par 2hx\tab Dble
\par 
\par Do you think this is a penalty double? Is it a takeout double?
\par 
\par The answer is both, and neither. It is a penalty double, but of spades and not hearts, and thus it is a takeout double of hearts. It makes no sense to double Two Hearts for penalties when the opponents are rarely going to play in that suit. (If you had
 five hearts, it is unlikely that LHO would prefer hearts to spades, and he certainly will not do so if you tell him that his trump suit is breaking badly.) Much more likely, double shows a hand such as...

\par 
\par Yes, you might have overcalled 1NT on the first round, but doing so is hardly automatic
. You also might be walking into a large penalty by coming in now, but if you pass it is all too likely that Two Hearts will end the auction. Is partner supposed to protect with:

\par 
\par You might beat Two Hearts, but you can certainly make an easy partscore in diamonds, and perhaps even a game. On a good day, partner will show up with something like:

\par 
\par He will be delighted to defend Two-Hearts Doubled, if that is LHO's choice, and no doubt you will be able to express an opinion should the enemy retreat to Two Spades.
\par 
\par *** Next month, we move around the table to look at some situations in which the fourth player to bid can use a double. Most pairs write "Responsive Doubles" on their conventions cards. Few make maximum use of these very useful weapons.
